     Reference Interaction Models for Remote Attestation Procedures
         draft-birkholz-rats-reference-interaction-model-latest

Abstract

   This document describes interaction models for remote attestation
   procedures (RATS).  Three conveying mechanisms - Challenge/Response,
   Uni-Directional, and Attestation Telemetry - are illustrated and
   defined.  Analogously, a general overview about the information
   elements typically used by corresponding conveyance protocols are
   highlighted.  Privacy preserving conveyance of Evidence via Direct
   Anonymous Attestation is elaborated on for each interaction model,
   individually.

1.  Introduction

   Remote ATtestation procedureS (RATS, [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture])
   are workflows composed of roles and interactions, in which Verifiers
   create Attestation Results about the trustworthiness of an Attester's
   system component characteristics.  The Verifier's assessment in the
   form of Attestation Results is created based on Attestation Policies
   and Evidence - trustable and temper-evident Claims Sets about an
   Attester's system component characteristics - created by an Attester.
   The roles _Attester_ and _Verifier_, as well as the Conceptual
   Messages _Evidence_ and _Attestation Results_ are terms defined by
   the RATS Architecture [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture].  This documents
   captures interaction models that can be used in specific RATS-related
   solution documents.  The primary focus of this document is the
   conveyance of attestation Evidence.  Specific goals of this document
   re to:

   *  prevent inconsistencies in descriptions of these interaction
      models in other documents (due to text cloning over time),

   *  enable to highlight an exact delta/divergence between the core set
      of characteristics captured here in this document and variants of
      these interaction models used in other specifications or
      solutions, and to

   *  illustrate the application of Direct Anonymous Attestation (DAA)
      for each of the interaction models described.

   In summary, this document enables the specification and design of
   trustworthy and privacy preserving conveyance methods for attestation
   Evidence from an Attester to a Verifier.  While the conveyance of
   other Conceptual Messages is out-of-scope [note: may still change]
   the methods described can also be applied to the conveyance of
   Endorsements or Attestation Results.

2.  Terminology

   This document uses the terms, roles, and concepts defined in
   [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture].

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Disambiguation

   The term "Remote Attestation" is a common expression and often
   associated with certain properties.  The term "Remote" in this
   context does not necessarily refer to a remote entity in the scope of
   network topologies or the Internet.  It rather refers to a decoupled
   system or entities that exchange the payload of the Conceptual
   Message type called Evidence [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture].  This
   conveyance can also be "local", if the Verifier is part of the same
   entity as the Attester, e.g., separate system components of a
   Composite Device (a single RATS Entity).  Examples of these types of
   co-located environments include: a Trusted Execution Environment
   (TEE), Baseboard Management Controllers (BMCs), as well as other
   physical or logical protected/isolated/shielded Computing
   Environments (e.g. embedded Secure Elements (eSE) or Trusted Platform
   Modules (TPM)).

4.  Scope

   This document focuses on generic interaction models between Attesters
   and Verifiers.  Complementary procedures, functions, or services that
   are required for a complete semantic binding of the concepts defined
   in [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture] are not in scope.  Examples include:
   identity establishment, key distribution and enrollment, as well as
   certificate revocation.

   Furthermore, any processes and duties that go beyond carrying out
   remote attestation procedures are out-of-scope.  For instance, using
   the results of a remote attestation that are created by the Verifier,
   e.g., triggering remediation actions or recovery processes, as well
   as the remediation actions and recovery processes themselves, are
   also out-of-scope.

5.  Normative Prerequisites

   In order to ensure an appropriate conveyance of Evidence, the
   following set of prerequisites must be in place to support the
   implementation of interaction models:

   Attester Identity:  The provenance of Evidence with respect to a
      distinguishable Attesting Environment MUST be correct and
      unambiguous.

      An Attester Identity MAY be a unique identity, it MAY be included
      in a zero-knowledge proof (ZKP), or it MAY be part of a group
      signature.

   Attestation Evidence:  Evidence MUST be a set of well-formatted and



Birkholz & Eckel        Expires 14 December 2020                [Page 4]

Internet-Draft                    REIM                         June 2020


      well-protected Claims that an Attester can create and convey to a
      Verifier in a temper-evident manner.

      Evidence MUST include an indicator about its Freshness that can be
      understood by a Verifier.

   Attestation Evidence Authenticity:  Attestation Evidence MUST be
      correct and authentic.

      Attestation Evidence, in order to provide proof of authenticity,
      SHOULD be cryptographically associated with an identity document
      (e.g. an X.509 certificate or trusted key material), or SHOULD
      include a correct and unambiguous and stable reference to an
      accessible identity document.

   Authentication Secret:  An Authentication Secret MUST be available
      exclusively to an Attester's Attesting Environment.

      The Attester MUST protect Claims with that Authentication Secret,
      thereby proving the authenticity of the Claims included in
      Evidence.  The Authentication Secret MUST be established before
      RATS can take place.

6.  Generic Information Elements

   This section defines the information elements that can be used in all
   interaction models.  Varying from solution to solution, generic
   information elements can be either included in the scope of protocol
   messages or can be included in their payload.  Ultimately, they have
   to be conveyed in order to enable an interaction model.

   Attester Identity ('attesterIdentity'):  _mandatory_

      A statement about a distinguishable Attester made by an Endorser
      without accompanying evidence of its validity - used as proof of
      identity.

   Authentication Secret ID ('authSecID'):  _mandatory_

      A statement representing an identifier that MUST be associated
      with an Authentication Secret that is used to protect Evidence.

   Handle ('handle'):  _mandatory_

      A statement that is intended to uniquely distinguish received
      Evidence and/or determine the Freshness of Evidence.  A Verifier
      can also use a Handle as an indicator for authenticity or
      attestation provenance, as only Attesters and Verifiers that are



Birkholz & Eckel        Expires 14 December 2020                [Page 5]

Internet-Draft                    REIM                         June 2020


      intended to exchange Evidence should have knowledge of the
      corresponding Handles.  Examples include Nonces or signed
      timestamps.

   Claims ('claims'):  _mandatory_

      Claims are assertions that represent characteristics of an
      Attester.  Claims compose attestation Evidence and are, for
      example, used to appraise the integrity of an Attester by a
      Verifier.  The statements that compose the information elements in
      this section can also be expressed as Claims in Evidence by some
      solutions.

   Reference Claims ('refClaims')  _mandatory_

      Reference Claims are a specific subset of Appraisal Policies as
      defined in [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture].  Reference Claims are
      used to appraise the Claims received from an Attester via
      appraisal by direct comparison.  For example, Reference Claims MAY
      be Reference Integrity Measurements (RIMs) or assertions that are
      implicitly trusted because they are signed by a trusted authority
      (see Endorsements in [I-D.ietf-rats-architecture]).  Reference
      Claims typically represent (trusted) Claim sets about an
      Attester's intended platform operational state.

   Claim Selection ('claimSelection'):  _optional_

      A statement that represents a (sub-)set of Claims that can be
      created by an Attester.  Claim Selections can act as filters that
      can specify the exact set of Claims to be included in Evidence.
      An Attester MAY decide whether or not to provide all Claims as
      requested via a Claim Selection.

   Attestation Evidence ('signedAttestationEvidence'):  _mandatory_

      Evidence consists of an Authentication Secret ID that identifies
      an Authentication Secret, the Attester Identity, Claims, and a
      Handle.  Attestation Evidence MUST cryptographically bind all of
      these information elements.  The Evidence MUST be protected via
      the Authentication Secret.  The Authentication Secret MUST be
      trusted by the Verifier as authoritative.

   Attestation Result ('attestationResult'):  _mandatory_

      An Attestation Result is produced by the Verifier as the output of
      the appraisal of Evidence.  Attestation Results include condensed
      assertions about integrity or other characteristics of the
      corresponding Attester.

        |                                                            |

   The remote attestation procedure is initiated by the Verifier,
   sending an attestation request to the Attester.  The attestation
   request consists of a Nonce, a Authentication Secret ID, and a Claim
   Selection.  The Nonce guarantees attestation freshness.  The
   Authentication Secret ID selects the secret with which the Attester
   is requested to sign the Attestation Evidence.  The Claim Selection
   narrows down or increases the amount of received Claims, if required.
   If the Claim Selection is empty, then by default all Claims that are

Internet-Draft                    REIM                         June 2020


   available on the Attester MUST be signed and returned as Attestation
   Evidence.  For example, a Verifier may only be requesting a
   particular subset of information about the Attester, such as evidence
   about BIOS and firmware the Attester booted up with - and not include
   information about all currently running software.

   The Attester, after receiving the attestation request, collects the
   corresponding Claims that have been measured beforehand to compose
   the Attestation Evidence that the Verifier requested.  In the case
   that the Verifier did not provide a Claim Selection, the Attester
   collects all information that can be used as complementary Claims in
   the scope of the semantics of the remote attestation procedure.
   Conclusively, the Attester creates Attestation Evidence by signing
   the Attester Identity, the Claims, and the Nonce with the
   Authentication Secret identified by the Authentication Secret ID.
   The signed Attestation Evidence is transferred back to the Verifier.

   It is crucial at this point that Claims, the Nonce, as well as the
   Attester Identity information MUST be cryptographically bound to the
   signature of the Attestation Evidence.  It is not required for them
   to be present in plain text, though.  Cryptographic blinding MAY be
   used at this point.  For further reference see section Section 10.

   As soon as the Verifier receives the signed Attestation Evidence, it
   verifies the signature, the Attester Identity, the Nonce, and
   appraises the Claims.  This procedure is application-specific and can
   be carried out by comparing the Claims with corresponding Reference
   Claims, e.g., Reference Integrity Measurements (RIMs), or using other
   appraisal policies.  The final output of the Verifier are Attestation
   Results.  Attestation Results constitute new Claims about an
   Attester's properties and characteristics that enables relying
   parties, for example, to assess an Attester's trustworthiness.

8.  Further Context

   Depending on the use cases covered, there can be additional
   requirements.  An exemplary subset is illustrated in this section.

8.1.  Confidentiality

   Confidentiality of exchanged attestation information may be
   desirable.  This requirement usually is present when communication
   takes place over insecure channels, such as the public Internet.  In
   such cases, TLS may be uses as a suitable communication protocol that
   preserves confidentiality.  In private networks, such as carrier
   management networks, it must be evaluated whether or not the
   transport medium is considered confidential.

8.2.  Mutual Authentication

   In particular use cases mutual authentication may be desirable in
   such a way that a Verifier also needs to prove its identity to the
   Attester, instead of only the Attester proving its identity to the
   Verifier.

8.3.  Hardware-Enforcement/Support

   Depending on the requirements, hardware support for secure storage of
   cryptographic keys, crypto accelerators, or protected or isolated
   execution environments may be useful.  Well-known technologies are
   roots of trusts, such as Hardware Security Modules (HSM), Physically
   Unclonable Functions (PUFs), Shielded Secrets, or Trusted Executions
   Environments (TEEs).

9.  Implementation Status

   Note to RFC Editor: Please remove this section as well as references
   to [BCP205] before AUTH48.

   This section records the status of known implementations of the
   protocol defined by this specification at the time of posting of this
   Internet-Draft, and is based on a proposal described in [BCP205].
   The description of implementations in this section is intended to
   assist the IETF in its decision processes in progressing drafts to
   RFCs.  Please note that the listing of any individual implementation
   here does not imply endorsement by the IETF.  Furthermore, no effort
   has been spent to verify the information presented here that was
   supplied by IETF contributors.  This is not intended as, and must not
   be construed to be, a catalog of available implementations or their
   features.  Readers are advised to note that other implementations may
   exist.

   According to [BCP205], "this will allow reviewers and working groups
   to assign due consideration to documents that have the benefit of
   running code, which may serve as evidence of valuable experimentation
   and feedback that have made the implemented protocols more mature.
   It is up to the individual working groups to use this information as
   they see fit".

9.1.  Implementer

   The open-source implementation was initiated and is maintained by the
   Fraunhofer Institute for Secure Information Technology - SIT.

9.2.  Implementation Name

   The open-source implementation is named "CHAllenge-Response based
   Remote Attestation" or in short: CHARRA.

9.3.  Implementation URL

   The open-source implementation project resource can be located via:
   https://github.com/Fraunhofer-SIT/charra

9.4.  Maturity

   The code's level of maturity is considered to be "prototype".

9.5.  Coverage and Version Compatibility

   The current version (commit '847bcde') is aligned with the exemplary
   specification of the CoAP FETCH bodies defined in section Appendix A
   of this document.

9.6.  License

   The CHARRA project and all corresponding code and data maintained on
   github are provided under the BSD 3-Clause "New" or "Revised"
   license.

9.7.  Implementation Dependencies

   The implementation requires the use of the official Trusted Computing
   Group (TCG) open-source Trusted Software Stack (TSS) for the Trusted
   Platform Module (TPM) 2.0.  The corresponding code and data is also
   maintained on github and the project resources can be located via:
   https://github.com/tpm2-software/tpm2-tss/

   The implementation uses the Constrained Application Protocol
   [RFC7252] (http://coap.technology/) and the Concise Binary Object
   Representation [RFC7049] (https://cbor.io/).

10.  Security and Privacy Considerations

   In a remote attestation procedure the Verifier or the Attester MAY
   want to cryptographically blind several attributes.  For instance,
   information can be part of the signature after applying a one-way
   function (e. g. a hash function).

   There is also a possibility to scramble the Nonce or Attester
   Identity with other information that is known to both the Verifier
   and Attester.  A prominent example is the IP address of the Attester
   that usually is known by the Attester itself as well as the Verifier.
   This extra information can be used to scramble the Nonce in order to
   counter certain types of relay attacks.

Appendix A.  CDDL Specification for a simple CoAP Challenge/Response
             Interaction

   The following CDDL specification is an examplary proof-of-concept to
   illustrate a potential implementation of the Reference Interaction
   Model.  The transfer protocol used is CoAP using the FETCH operation.
   The actual resource operated on can be empty.  Both the Challenge
   Message and the Response Message are exchanged via the FETCH Request
   and FETCH Response body.
